# Graphite CLI

Graphite is an open source CLI + a code review dashboard on top of GitHub that makes creating & reviewing stacked changes fast & intuitive. We originally built Graphite internally because we missed tools like Phabricator (at Facebook) and Critique (Google) that help engineers create and ship small, incremental changes, and found reviewing code on GitHub to be slow and painful. Anyone can start using Graphite individually without needing their coworkers to change tools - sign in with GitHub and we'll seamlessly sync your code changes and reviews. Long-term, weâ€™re passionate about creating a powerful, modern code review experience (think Linear for CR) for fast-moving eng teams.
