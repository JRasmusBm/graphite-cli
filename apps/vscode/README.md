To launch it, you can either:

- Run the **Graphite: Open Graphite interactive** command from the [command palette](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette).
- [Define your own keyboard shortcut](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings) to run the `graphite.open-gti` command.

More information about this extension can be found [on the Graphite website](https://graphite.dev/docs/gti/).

**Note: This extension does not include the Graphite CLI itself.** You must install the Graphite CLI through the [normal installation instructions](https://graphite.dev/docs/installing-the-cli)
in order for the VS Code extension to work.
